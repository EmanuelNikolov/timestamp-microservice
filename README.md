Timestamp Microservice API for [FCCs Apis And Microservices Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.com)

## Usage

Clone this repository to your server's public folder

`git clone https://github.com/EmanuilNikolov/timestamp-microservice.git`

Run your server, visit `localhost` and navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository

### Pre-Requisites needed
- Apache Server and PHP installed (I personally use the XAMPP bundle)

### User Requirements:
- I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).

- If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.

- If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
